# Introduction

Data sharing is making the same data available to one or more consumers. Nowadays, the ever-growing amount of data has become a strategic asset for any company. Sharing data - within your organization or externally - is an enabling technology for new business opportunities. Sharing data and consuming data from external sources allows to collaborate with partners, establish new partnerships and generate new revenue streams with data monetization.

## Why Use Data Sharing?

Data Sharing allows customers to improve their business and open up new opportunities. Examples of Data Sharing scenarios:

* One organization shares data across LOBs where an HR department can share statistical employee data with the Financial department for cost analysis.
* Business to Business (B2B) where a retailer shares regional sales and inventory data with a supplier to help improve the supplier's production line and locations.
* Business to Customers (B2C) where a restaurant shares historical time-based pattern of busyness to allow customers to plan for their reservations.

### What is a Data Lake?
A data lake enables an enterprise to store all of its data in a cost effective, elastic environment while providing the necessary processing, persistence, and analytic services to discover new business insights. A data lake stores and curates structured and unstructured data and provides methods for organizing large volumes of highly diverse data from multiple sources. In this workshop, a Data Lake refers to the Oracle Object Storage buckets that you will harvest in Data Catalog and query in ADB.

### What is a Data Warehouse?
With a data warehouse, you perform data transformation and cleansing before you commit the data to the warehouse. With a data lake, you ingest data quickly and prepare it on the fly as people access it. A data lake supports operational reporting and business monitoring that require immediate access to data and flexible analysis to understand what is happening in the business while it happening.
